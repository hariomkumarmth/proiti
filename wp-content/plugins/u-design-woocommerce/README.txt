==========================================================

COMPATIBILITY:
==========================================================
Built and tested for:
  - U-Design: Version 1.9.0

==========================================================

Please feel free to install and activate the attached plugin ("u-design-woocommerce.zip") which will give you full integration of "<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="U-Design" href="http://themeforest.net/item/udesign-wordpress-theme/253220?ref=internq7">U-Design</a>" with "<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="WooCommerce eCommerce WordPress plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce eCommerce WordPress plugin</a>".

NOTES:
==========================================================
-> The plugin will also check if "U-Design" and "WooCommerce" are currently active, and only then run.
-> The plugin doesn't have its own configuration page, there's really no need for that, you just activate it and move onto setting up your WooCommerce plugin.
-> This plugin will also add a new widget which I recommend you use with the "Top Area Social Media" widget area which will add dynamically updated shopping cart information and account links to the top area of the site.
-> It integrates pagination with WP-PageNavi plugin if installed.
-> For most of the Pages that are editable though the WordPress backend you could assign any sidebar to them, or "full-width page" template if you prefer to not have a sidebar, however there are some instances of the WooComm. pages like the single product pages that require a sidebar which you cannot choose, in this case I have assigned the "PageSidebar8" widget area to be used programmatically.
-> All the default images ("Catalog Images", "Single Product Image", "Product Thumbnails") have been preset for best results and I don't recommend you to re-size them.

HELP & SUPPORT:
==========================================================
-> If you have any questions about this integration I have put together a Section WooCommerce Integration (http://dreamthemedesign.com/u-design-support/categories/woocommerce-integration), please post your questions under it.
-> The support we provide here is limited strictly to this integration and NOT to WooCommerce plugin itself, for specific questions about that plugin please turn to the plugin's own support.
-> I decided to keep this integration as a plugin and not built into the theme, so that I can independently of the theme do updates to it should issues arise.
